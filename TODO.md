TODO
====

* Check diffuse example
* Check if previous example are not broken
* Example - generated 'city of rectangles'
* Consider colors in materials as strings

* List of objects

* Introduce mesh and different types of primitives

* Use uniform buffer objects
* Buffer objects with mapping


* Use full sequence of NEWT calls from Jogl's Hello Triangle example
* Different representation of colors (RGBA vector, hex number) - how to deal with them?
* Primitives (triangle, strips) - then review simple-scene and others 

* Transformations (model)
* Camera (projection, view)
* Projection - perspective, orthogonal

* Diffuse light
* Shining

* Texture

Plan
====

1) Transformations
    * model
    * view
    * projection (perspective, orthogonal)
1) Index arrays
1) Many types of vertex arrays (positions, normals, texture)
1) Normal material
1) Cube
1) Different parts - different materials (colors)
1) Ambient light, diffuse light
1) Specular light
    * per vertex
    * per fragment
1) Texture
    * uv mapping
    * sky box
    * bump mapping
1) Font rendering
1) Scene graph
1) Local transformations
1) Lights and cameras as scene nodes
1) OBJ loader
1) OpenGEX loader
